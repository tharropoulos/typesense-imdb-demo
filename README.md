## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Ruby (with Bundler)
- Node.js and npm/pnpm

### Setup Steps

#### 1. Get the Recommendations model

```bash
huggingface-cli download typesense/movie-recommendations-20m --local-dir ./movie-recommendations-model && cd movie-recommendations-model
```

```bash
tar -czvf ../movie-recommendations-model.tar.gz *.onnx vocab.txt prompts.json
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
# or if using pnpm
pnpm install

# Install or update Ruby dependencies
bundle install
```

#### 3. Start the Docker containers

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts Typesense search server with the configuration defined in your `docker-compose.yml`.

#### 4. Set up the database

# Apply migrations
rails db:migrate
```

#### 5. Seed the database

```bash
# Seed user data
rake db:seed_users

# Import IMDB data
rake imdb:import

# Seed ratings data
rake imdb:seed_ratings

# Set up Typesense (search engine)
bundle exec rake typesense:setup
```

#### 6. Initialize search indices

```bash
# Open the Rails console
rails c

# Within the console, reindex all searchable models:
Movie.reindex!
Person.reindex!
TvShow.reindex!

# Movie relationships
MovieDirector.reindex!
MovieCast.reindex!
MovieWriter.reindex!

# TV Show relationships
TvShowDirector.reindex!
TvShowCast.reindex!
TvShowWriter.reindex!

# Exit the console
exit
```

#### 7. Start the development server

```bash
bin/dev
```

#### 8. Access the application

The application will be available at:

[http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100)

## Usage

### Searching for Movies and TV Shows

### Browsing Content

Browse movies and TV shows by genre, release year, or rating. The application provides faceted navigation to help you discover new content.

### Personalized Recommendations

Once you create an account or use any of the pre-made ones and interact with the application by viewing or rating content, the system will start providing personalized recommendations based on your preferences and viewing history.

### Rating and Reviewing
